# Public API
Kaiterra's public API allows your programs to access the air quality data reported by your Laser Egg or Sensedge.

- For API documentation, see [www.kaiterra.com/dev](https://www.kaiterra.com/dev).
- To get an API key, create an account on [dashboard.kaiterra.com](https://dashboard.kaiterra.com).  Then, in your account's Profile, visit the Developer page, and click **Generate a new key**.
- If you're a [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) user, try out the API by importing the collection at `https://www.postman.com/collections/76cc3bba7659a6ace181`. Note that you'll need to create a Postman environment with a variable called `api-key` (set to your Kaiterra API key) to try the examples in the collection.
- If you're a Python user, check [here](examples/restv1-apikey.py) for some working code.
